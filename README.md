###@Webonise

My first job. I started my career with Webonise Lab. A humble and small IT firm that came into existence in 2009. Webonise Lab was made with a clear definition of its goals and started with a crew of just 4 people that grew on to 10 (by the time I joined..) - 10 very determined and young minds. All of them freshly out of college who had joined forces forming a strong team with their interleaving skills and interests. Webonise is an outsourced product development company that goes about building applications that people love!
